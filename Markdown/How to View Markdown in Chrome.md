There're many ways to view md files in Chrome. I added `Markdown Preview Plus` as an extension.

### Markdown Preview Plus

- Converts and previews markdown files (.md, .markdown) to HTML right inside Chrome.
- Automatically parses markdown files (.md) into HTML. This is useful if you're writing markdown (ultimately targeting HTML) and want a quick preview.

__Note__: The auto reload feature is disabled default.

Usage:

1. Install extension from webstore (creates no new UI)
2. Check "Allow access to file URLs" in chrome://extensions listing:
3. Open local or remote .md file in Chrome.
4. See nicely formatted HTML!

Features:

* Support change theme for the special page.
* Support auto reload.
* Support external css file.
* Support highlight code.
